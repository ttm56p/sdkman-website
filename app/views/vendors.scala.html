                <article><p>SDKMAN! is unique in that it empowers SDK Vendors to publish their own
                    Candidate releases on our platform. We provide a secure API that can be used to
                    manage all aspects of a release on SDKMAN!. This includes
                    <strong>Releasing</strong> a new Version, setting an existing Version as
                    <strong>Default</strong> (Stable) and <strong>Announcing</strong> the release on
                    the SDKMAN! CLI broadcast and Twitter feed.</p></article>
                <article><a name='operations'></a>
                    <h3>Operations</h3>
                    <p>The API is a simple JSON REST API that allows several operations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Release a new Candidate Version</li>
                        <li>Make a Version the Default for a given Candidate</li>
                        <li>Broadcast a structured release message</li>
                        <li>Broadcast a freeform message</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p></article>
                <article><a name='access'></a>
                    <h3>Access</h3>
                    <p>This is a secured API, and requires appropriate credentials to perform the
                        above operations. Access will be granted on a
                        case-by-case basis to Vendors who are interested in making their technology
                        available on SDKMAN!. If you want to publish your releases
                        on SDKMAN!, please <a href='mailto:info@@sdkman.io'>contact us</a> to help
                        get you onboarded.</p></article>
                <article><a name='endpoints'></a>
                    <h3>Endpoints</h3>The simplest way to call the API is by using cURL. Of course,
                    any other client can be used to perform the API operations:<p><h4>Release a new
                        Candidate Version</h4>This will perform a Minor Release on SDKMAN!. It will
                    simply add the new Candidate Version, but will not make it the default version
                    for the Candidate.
                    <pre><code>
curl -X POST \
-H "Consumer-Key: CONSUMER_KEY" \
-H "Consumer-Token: CONSUMER_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{"candidate": "groovy", "version": "2.4.2", "url": "http://dl.bintray.com/groovy/maven/groovy-binary-2.4.2.zip"}' \
https://vendors.sdkman.io/release
                    </code></pre>
                    </p><br/>
                    <p><h4>Set existing Version as Default for Candidate</h4>When calling this
                    endpoint for an existing Candidate Version, it will make it the Default Version
                    for that Candidate. This makes a Minor release a Major release!
                    <pre><code>
curl -X PUT \
-H "Consumer-Key: CONSUMER_KEY" \
-H "Consumer-Token: CONSUMER_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{"candidate": "groovy", "version": "2.3.8"}' \
https://vendors.sdkman.io/default
                    </code></pre>
                    </p><br/>
                    <p><h4>Broadcast a Structured Message</h4>This will result in a structured
                    message announcement on social media and SDKMAN! CLI. The result will look
                    something like: <code>grails 3.0.0 available for download. https://git.io/release</code>.
					The url can point to the github release page or the version's changelog.
                    This message will be announced to the broadcast channel of SDKMAN! CLI, as well
                    as on the <a href='https://www.twitter.com/sdkman_'>@@sdkman_</a> Twitter feed.
                    <pre><code>
curl -X POST \
-H "Consumer-Key: CONSUMER_KEY" \
-H "Consumer-Token: CONSUMER_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-d '{"candidate": "grails", "version": "3.0.0", "url": "https://git.io/release"}' \

                    <h3>Gradle SDK Vendor Plugin</h3>
                    <p>If fiddling with cURL (or HttpClient) isn’t your thing, you could consider
                        using our Gradle plugin. The plugin allows the release to be done as a side
                        effect of your CI build! It exposes several useful tasks like:
                    <ul>

                    </ul>
                    It also exposes some convenience tasks that roll the above into single tasks:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>sdkMajorRelease</code>: performs release, default and structured
